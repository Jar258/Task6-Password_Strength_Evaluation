Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

Objective:
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

Tools Used:
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- Screenshots of password evaluations

Password Evaluations:

1. Password: `Tiger123`
Strength: Very Weak
Time to Crack: 0.09 seconds
Feedback: Common word + number pattern, short length. Easily guessable.

2. Password: `Secure!2025`
Strength: Weak
Time to Crack: 33.56 minutes
Feedback: Contains dictionary words, weak structure despite symbols/numbers.

3. Password: `C@tChM3_IfUCan`
Strength: Very Strong
Time to Crack: 86 years
Feedback: Great use of upper/lower case, numbers, and symbols. Not a common phrase.

4. Password: `Pa$$phr@s3_4_S3cur1ty!`
Strength: Very Strong
Time to Crack: 14 centuries
Feedback: Excellent length, complex and unique. Best among all tested.

Tips I Learned:
- Use longer passwords with symbols, numbers, upper/lowercase letters.
- Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.
- Passphrases are secure when creatively written.
- Unique, complex structures significantly increase strength.

How Password Complexity Affects Security:
Stronger passwords make brute force and dictionary attacks significantly harder. Complexity increases the number of combinations an attacker must try, often making cracking infeasible.

Research Summary:
Brute Force Attack: Tries all combinations — weak passwords fall quickly.
Dictionary Attack: Uses common words — passwords with real words are vulnerable.
Multi-Factor Authentication: Adds another security layer beyond passwords.
Password Managers: Help manage and create strong passwords without reuse.
